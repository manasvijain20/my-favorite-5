        <p> My hobby is reading books. I like reading books written by Ruskin bond and Sudha Murthy. I read books in my spare time. Reading books helps me distract myslef from all of my problems. It also helps me escape from my everyday life and dive deep into the book. Reading books keeps you occupied, improves vocabulary, reduces stress, aids sleep, increases empathy and develops our thoughts. </p>

            <h2> Sudha Murthy </h2>
            <p> Sudha Murthy is my favorite author. Sudha Murthy is an Indian engineering teacher, Kannada, Marathi and English author as well as a Social worker. She is also the Chairperson of the Infosys Foundation. She is married to co-founder of Infosys, N. R. Narayana Murthy. Sudha Murthy began her professional career in computer science and engineering. Sudha Murthy is best known for her social work and her contribution to literature in Kannada and English. Dollar Bahu (English: Dollar Daughter-in-Law), a novel originally authored by her in Kannada and later translated into English as Dollar Bahu, was adapted as a televised dramatic series by Zee TV in 2001.[6] Sudha Murthy has also acted in the Marathi film Pitruroon and the Kannada film Prarthana. She has also appeared in Kaun Banega Crorepati season 11 in its Karamveer episode of finale week. </p>

            <h2> Ruskin Bond </h2>
            <p>Besides Sudha Murthy I also love the books written by Ruskin Bond.Born on May 19, 1934, in Kasauli, India, he was the son of Edith Clarke and Aubrey Bond. The Indian Council for Child Education has recognised his role in the growth of children's literature in India.At the age of 17 in London, he began to write his first novel, The Room on the Roof. The novel charts the life of an orphaned Anglo-Indian teenager. He runs away to live with his friends as he escapes the tyranny of his strict guardian. The book has a strong autobiographical element as itâ€™s based on his actual experiences living in a small rented room on the roof in Dehradun. </p>
